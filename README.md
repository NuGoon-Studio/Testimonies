Sharing stories of faith.

## Overview
### Intro
Testimonies is a mobile application to share the gospel through our individual experiences. By sharing our stories of faith outside the church we can reach people who otherwise would never receive the hope from testimonies accumulated over a life time of growth.

### Objective
Share personal stories of faith, perseverance and trials to inspire and encourage others going through similar situations. Our goal is for users to receive hope, receive prayer and be found by others seeking the same.

### Features
- Tag based sorting system for testimonies. 
- Daily testimonies of gratitude and prayer. 
- Ongoing testimonies you can follow and pray for.

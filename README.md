Sharing stories of faith.

## Overview
### Intro
Testimonies is a mobile application to share the gospel through our individual experiences. By sharing our stories of faith outside the church we can reach people who otherwise would never receive the hope from testimonies accumulated over a life time of growth.

### Objective
Share personal stories of faith, perseverance and trials to inspire and encourage others going through similar situations. Our goal is for users to receive hope, receive prayer and be found by others seeking the same.

### Features
- Tag based sorting system for testimonies. 
- Daily testimonies of gratitude and prayer. 
- Ongoing testimonies you can follow and pray for.

## Challenges
### Sorting Testimonies
Mimicking the “fan out” approach
utilized by Twitter, I plan to create data stores for each tag. Testimony ids will be entered into these stores. In addition to the system design, predefined tag values will mitigate performance degradation across user-defined tags.

### Sharing Anonymously
Being able to share and read personal struggles and victories publicly is a powerful thing. However, there are many instances when a user may not want to share their identity. By combining a privacy flag and obfuscating posts we can provide users activity on their feed, prayer and encouragement without bearing the shame of what they have gone through.

### Backend Development
With direction from close colleagues, I’m excited to implement a RESTFUL API from the ground up. My experience with the backend has been reserved to a handful of routes and modification of existing routes. The limited scope of the project allows for the growth of my abilities as an engineer. This will officially transition my skillset from frontend to full stack engineer.
